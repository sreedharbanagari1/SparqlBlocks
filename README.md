# SparqlBlocks
Using Blockly library for building SPARQL queries with blocks.

http://sparqlblocks.org/

## Usage

Just serve statically the content of the directory `./dist`.

For example, if you have python installed you can use SimpleHTTPServer

```sh
cd dist
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

and then open http://localhost:8080/.

Alternatively, you can use the nodejs server in [SparqlBlocks-Server](https://github.com/sreedharbanagari1/SparqlBlocks-Server) that offers also logging capability.
